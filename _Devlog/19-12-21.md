## Week of 19/12/21
### 19/12/21
#### Getting Into It
Starting off today, we'll be looking at sketch '17122021-0.jpg'
The new cata conceptual structure is based off of this sketch.

#### Goals
- [ ] Understand the functions required for each 'Agent' present
- [ ] Create 'Agent' Classes
- [ ] Progress on 'Agent' Function Implementation

### 21/12/21
#### Getting Into It
So, last devsess didn't last very long, and I don't think this one will
either. But alas! We push forward and strive towards progress.

Today will focus '19122021-0.jpg' and understanding how the Indexes
interact with the other Agents to modify and read the data.

### 22/12/21
#### Starting off...
Trying to figure out Issue #4 regarding Update Log Structure.
This in turn will aid with the progress of Issue #3.

#### Goals
- [x] Create a Data Structure to house entry change data.
- [ ] Create the `ModifyDataSet()` function

### Closing Off
Today was quite productive!
Moving forward, I would like to start work on the Manager classes 
and working on the DataSet Engineer's asynchronous UpdateLogReceive 
mechanism.
