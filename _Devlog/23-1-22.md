### 29/1/2022
#### Opening Statements
It's been a while since I last did any programming. Took a break on some smaller projects
and that was fun, but I recently lost sight of my vision and I've been struggling with some
mental stuff.
That aside, I want to get back into this. No expectations, I just want to create
something cool that could help me in creating worlds and campaigns for D&D.

I want to be proud of what I end up with. So I'm just going to plod along and do good
work.


Last time I worked on this, I tried to better understand asynchronous programming
and SpotifyAPI implementation, but I want to focus on the NPC Register and getting
the MVP sorted out.

### Todays Goals
- [ ] Gain familiarity with where I left off
