## Week of 6-3-22
### 8/3/22
#### Cracking on
So! It's been a while.
The audio prototyping made the project seem much larger than what I needed it to be,
and me letting my imagination run wild on the concept *during* a coding session
was not helping me with the problem at hand: the fucking UI.

So, how about I create a low fidelity UI controller that suits the purposes I want.
Just keep plodding along, I really want to create this tool.

Let's go!

#### Goals
##### Starting Goals
- [x] Familiarise myself with the project agian.
- [x] ~~Create some basic UI to display in hierarchy 2.~~
> Already here champ, just keep it as is until you can find a more accurate element.

##### Added Goals
- [ ] Begin working on the workspace/note scripts.

#### In Closing
So! Mainly a catch up session with not a whole lot of productivity,
although I'm happy with my current theory/progress with workspace notes.
Just gotta make them work, but that'll be a task for another Nic :P
