#### Going Into It
So! It's been a while, and I want to keep working on this project.
Looking at my last devlog, I wanted to understand the relationships between the main objects in a way that can be easily
modelled and understood for SQL.
Immediately, I'm thinking about using ORM to achieve this, but there might be another way.

Now, looking at the 'NPC Register' project, I still need to finish my SQLite implementations.
Thankfully, understanding the relationships between the core objects is part of that understanding.
How about I create a new script and see what happens?

#### Todays Goals
- [x] Design NPC Relationships
- [x] Begin Creation of Low-Fidelity Database Framework

#### In Closing
What a day to get stuff done!
Both goals were met, but there is more to be done.
I created the file 'Table Creation.sql' and fiddled around with it.
Now we have a FULLY WORKING SQL DATABASE!
WOOO!
> I'm really happy I got this __mostly__ done today.'

I was trying to create a method of reading from the database even after
the initial reading, but I understood this new process:

OnProjectLoad --> SQL Data to C# Data

OnData Change --> C# to C#

OnProjectClose --> C# Data to SQL Data

Basically, while the project is open and the user is producing work,
there is no need to read from a the database. The only time reading and
writing will occur is at the beginning or the end of a work session.

I created a few functions before I understood this important detail,
but alas the effort has not been in vain.

For future Nik:
- Those functions weren't a waste, repurpose them for when you create
'SaveProject'
- Work on Converting SQL to C# objects.
