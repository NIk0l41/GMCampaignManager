#### To Do
[x] Start modelling and understanding relationships between key Objects and Secondary Objects.
#### Notes
The idea of 'tagging' objects in the GMCM is very appealing and I want to really implement that.
They add a better way of seaching for certain types of objects in writing sessions, and a way to organise seperated items.

I did little to no work on the main feature that spawned this idea: Playlists and Music.
That'll have to be tomorrows job :P
