# GMCampaignManager
#### Project Summary
To create an application that addresses:
1. Game Master Creative Freedom
   1.1 Provides Powerful Creative Tools
   1.2 Efficiently Stores and Retrieves Data
   1.3 Allows for Flexible Customisation
2. In Game Ease of Use
   2.1 Displays Useful 'On The Fly' Information
   2.2 Allows Easy Access to Information linked to 'On The Fly'
   2.3 Offloads Tedious Tracking



It hopes to address these issues through
- Seperating (1) from (2), presenting 'Writing' and 'Playing' modes.
- Implementing complete malleability of user created object data
- Customising how the program interacts with certain objects to allow for a more personalised workflow
- Creating a data architecture that is simple, clean, and normalised.
- Providing features that offload some tedious environmental tasks.
- Featuring 'Session Plan' objects to limit what information is shown to the GM, highlighting only what they think they need.
- Equipping a 'Search Bar' and 'Tag Filter' to "Note Check" obscure information much faster

### Devlog 13/11/2021
#### To Do
- [x] Start modelling and understanding relationships between key Objects and Secondary Objects.
#### Notes
The idea of 'tagging' objects in the GMCM is very appealing and I want to really implement that.
They add a better way of seaching for certain types of objects in writing sessions, and a way to organise seperated items.

I did little to no work on the main feature that spawned this idea: Playlists and Music.
That'll have to be tomorrows job :P
