Righto, so I got the software reading from the sqlite database no dramas.
What will I have to do to the 'Agents' to make them compatible with this

I suppose that shouldn't be a huge worry from this point, but still.
Alas, this will make my data management issues much less of a hassle,
since everything can just be piped on through to the SQL server.
